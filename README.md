python based blackjack game custom rules

When you start the game you are greeted with line telling you how much money you currently possess. By default it will be $100.

You can pick a bet ammount but you can't bet above the ammount you have.

Once you have entered the bet ammount the program will deal you and the dealer 2 cards. One of the dealers cards will be hidden.

You will now be prompted with an option to either hit or stand. By pressing h the program will give you an additional card. If s is pressed no card is dealt to the user.

The dealer will pick up a card regardless of what the user pressed.

This can be repeated multiple times till the player or the dealer busts aka crosses 21. If at any time the player gets a perfect 21, then they would win immediately.

If the dealer crosses a value of 17 we will reach a showdown phase where the hidden card is revealed. If the player has a value closer to 21 then the player wins otherwise the dealer will win. If either the player or dealer crosses 21 then they would lose.

By winning the player will make double the ammount of what they had betted. If lost, the player will lose the betted ammount.

The game will continue till the player has no money after which they have the option to restart the game with $100 again.
